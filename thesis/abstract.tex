Modern manufacturing technologies enable the design and fabrication of objects with extraordinary physical properties. A wide range of applications have been demonstrated in the fields of mechanics, acoustics, optics and electromagnetics.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to design objects manually or with optimization algorithms in the large combinatorial space of possible designs.
We propose to speed up simulation and inverse design of manufacturable objects using a multiscale method.
We first construct a library of microstructures with their bulk material properties.
Discrete and continuous search methods are used to push the structures to the limits of achievable material properties.
With the library, functional objects can be designed using the microstructures.
This allows us to simulate and optimize objects at a much coarser scale.
Additionally, the representation of the microstructure envelope provides a way to discover families of microstructures with extremal physical properties.
