\chapter{Introduction}
Crafting the behavior of a deformable object is difficult---whether
it is a biomechanically accurate character model or a new multimaterial
3D printable design.
Getting it right requires constant iteration,
performed either manually or driven by an automated system.
These design iterations often require many expensive physical prototypes
that takes months to make and test.
Physics-driven computational design can be used to reduce the time and cost of designing such systems.

Instead of using physical prototypes, predictive physics-based simulation can be used to evaluate the performance of given designs.
The gold standard technique for estimating the mechanical behavior
of a deformable object under load is the finite element method
(FEM).
While accurate, FEM is notoriously slow, making it a major
bottleneck in the iterative design process.
This is because FEM is only accurate with a sufficiently high-resolution discretization.
In order to apply FEM to design problems, we require simulation techniques that are fast and accurate even in the face of constant tinkering.
In this thesis, we propose to achieve efficiency using low-resolution meshes while ensuring accuracy by computing new material models for the coarse finite elements.
\section{Background}
Computational design concerns itself with optimizing the shape and material assignment in an object in order to control its large scale behavior.
Advances in computational design, physical modeling and rapid manufacturing 
have enabled the automated design and fabrication of objects with customized physical properties.
The range of media and applications addressed in previous literature is very diverse spanning optical properties, inertia, strength, elasticity etc.
In the area of designing optical properties, \citet{Hasan:2010:PRO} and
\citet{Dong:2010:FSS} provided methods for printing objects with desired subsurface scattering properties. Objects have been made to reflect or bend light to create custom images \citep{papas11goal,Weyrich:2009,kiser2013}.
The inertia tensor of an object has been designed for stable standing~\citep{Prevost:2013kb}, floating~\citep{musialski-2015}
and spinning~\citep{Bacher:2014}.
The aerodynamic behavior of rigid mechanisms have been considered to design  paper airplanes~\citep{Umetani:2014}, kites~\citep{Martin:2015}, and multi-copters~\citep{Du:2016}.
For 3D-printed objects, many researchers have investigated how to improve structural strength~\citep{Stava:2012,Zhou:2013,Langlois:2016,Wu:2016,Ulu:2017}.
More complex mechanisms have been designed to achieve specified motions using kinematics~\citep{Zhu:2012,Coros:2013:CDM,Bacher:2015,Megaro:2017}.

The most relevant line of work is the design and fabrication of deformable objects with prescribed behavior under load.
The behavior is usually controlled by altering the material
composition and shape of the designs.
\citet{Bickel:2010:DAF} used a measurement based material model to design 
layered soft structures with prescribed non-linear static deformation behavior.
\citet{Chen:2014:ANM} optimized the rest shape of a deformable object such that 
it deforms the right way under gravity.
Later, researchers use material composition and geometry to control 
articulated characters~\citep{Bickel:2012,Skouras13Computational}.
Like these works, one of our goals is to efficiently design compliant objects 
with desired deformation behavior. These work assume a small set of available 
base materials such a stiff and a soft material.
To expand the range of material building blocks, the base materials are 
organized into larger structures known as microstructures.
These microstructures are then used in design optimization loop to 
compose objects with specified compliant 
properties~\citep{Schumacher:2015,Panetta:2015,Zhu:2017:TTO}.
