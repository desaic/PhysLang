\chapter{Introduction}
Crafting the behavior of a deformable object is difficult---whether
it is a biomechanically accurate character model or a new multimaterial
3D printable design.
Getting it right requires constant iteration,
performed either manually or driven by an automated system.
These design iterations often require many expensive physical prototypes
that takes months to make and test.
Physics-driven computational design can be used to reduce the time and cost of designing such systems.

Instead of using physical prototypes, predictive physics-based simulation can be used to evaluate the performance of given designs.
The gold standard technique for estimating the mechanical behavior
of a deformable object under load is the finite element method
(FEM).
While accurate, FEM is notoriously slow, making it a major
bottleneck in the iterative design process.
This is because FEM is only accurate with a sufficiently high-resolution discretization.
In order to apply FEM to design problems, we require simulation techniques that are fast and accurate even in the face of constant tinkering.
In this thesis, we propose to achieve efficiency using low-resolution meshes while ensuring accuracy by computing new material models for the coarse finite elements.
\section{Background}
Computational design concerns itself with optimizing the shape and material assignment in an object in order to control its large scale behavior.
Advances in computational design, physical modeling and rapid manufacturing 
have enabled the automated design and fabrication of objects with customized physical properties.
The range of media and applications addressed in previous literature is very diverse spanning optical properties, inertia, strength, elasticity etc.
In the area of designing optical properties, \citet{Hasan:2010:PRO} and
\citet{Dong:2010:FSS} provided methods for printing objects with desired subsurface scattering properties. Objects have been made to reflect or bend light to create custom images \citep{papas11goal,Weyrich:2009,kiser2013}.
The inertia tensor of an object has been designed for stable standing~\citep{Prevost:2013kb}, floating~\citep{musialski-2015}
and spinning~\citep{Bacher:2014}.
The aerodynamic behavior of rigid mechanisms have been considered to design  paper airplanes~\citep{Umetani:2014}, kites~\citep{Martin:2015}, and multi-copters~\citep{Du:2016}.

Applications of computational design extend
from stable standing and spinning [Pr´evost et al. 2013; B¨acher et al.
2014] to mechanism design [Coros et al. 2013; Thomaszewski et al.
2014] and deformable character manufacture [Bickel et al. 2012;
Skouras et al. 2013],
 Stability of 3D printed objects has been later considered by Stava et al. [2012], structural
strength by Zhou et al. [2013], rest shape by Chen et al. [2014].
Closer to our present work, frameworks for the design of objects
174 with desired mechanical behaviours have been proposed by Bickel
175 et al. [2010] and Skouras et al. [2013]. Like these works, our sys176
tem also allows to match given input deformations. However, while
177 these previous systems assume a small set of available base materi178
als and use these base materials in relatively coarse discretizations,
179 our system combines the base materials into microstructures to ex180
pand the design possibilities. Also relevant is the tool presented by
181 Xu et al. [2015] that allows to interactively design heterogeneous
182 materials for elastic objects subject to prescribed displacement and
183 forces. However, their method does not target fabricable objects
184 specifically and might produce materials that are not available in
185 the real world. In an effort to unify individual contributions when
186 dealing with inverse modeling problems, Chen et al. [2013]
